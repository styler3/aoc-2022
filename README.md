# Advent of code 2022

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022].

To start a new day, copy the `template` directory. For example, to start day 1:

    cp -r template day01

Then fill in the TODOs in the new directory. You can run the tests for any
given day. For example, to run the tests for day 1:

    npm test day01
